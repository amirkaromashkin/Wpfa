# Wpfa
Wpfa - is a automation framework, born and widely used in Deutsche Bank. 
Due to DB policies, it is illegal to move framework to opensource.

Still we've had an opportinuty to share a concept of the framework on Go# conference in April, 2015.

This project - is a Proof Of Concept, a prototype of an idea of a large internal Deutsche Bank project.

Concept was originally created by Eugene Gorelov, Deutsche Bank Software Engineer.

P.S. If you are Deutche Bank complience: This code was created at leisure time on personal lapton and was not copy-pasted.
